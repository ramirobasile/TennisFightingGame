TennisFightingGame TODO List
============================


Known bugs to be fixed
----------------------

* Jumping on top of things doesn't work very well... But it's not like you're
  supposed to do that anyway... For now anyways
* Ball going thought geometry sometimes apparently only when ball's left
  collision occurs
* Landing point isn't calculated correctly when bounce off of wall
* Fix attack animations
* If the ball somehow manages to cross the net after point ends, AND it's the
  game point, camera for next serve gets a bit confused


TODO
----

* Go through TODOs and HACKs
* Step sounds
* Special exhausted swing and hit sounds
* Character select portraits and stuff
* Inputs viewer in training mode and general training overhaul
* Endurance
* Allow scaling
* More documentation
* Add (and probably fix) particles
* Doubles (currently blocked by collision FIXME)


Minor TODOs
-----------

* Some of Monkey's attacks have 0 shakeMagnitude


Conundrums
----------

* Custom amount of games?
* Maybe add notion of phantom hit which isn't accounted for by match manager,
  which I picture being used for cool super moves
* Maybe add target combos?
* NonHeld buffer clearing mode allows sliding, which is very cool, but the
  trade-off is your run gets buffered after attacking, which feels very weird.
  It's not as bad as having no slide though... I think
* Should we have a Collisionmanager? Could be of use in Doubles
* Consider a special interaction (penalty) for when a hit depletes fully your
  stamina


Backburner
----------

* Finish Wizard
* Give Chino a special standing heavy (maybe)
* Give Monkey a billion specials
* Parallax background
* Music
* Crowd SFX
* Add taunting
* Titles
* XML character serialization
* DInput support (this is never gonna happen probably)
