TennisFightingGame TODO List
============================


Known bugs to be fixed (by priority)
------------------------------------

1. The UI bar for stamina on training mode doesn't behave correctly

   For some inexplicable reason, the lagFillRectangle is totally incorrect in
   training mode... despite nothing of note being different in how training
   handles bars as opposed to singles.

2. Landing point of the ball isn't calculated correctly when it bounces off of a
   wall

   While this is not intended to ever come in to play, it'd be nice to have
   it work correctly.

3. Sound panning not working very well


Unconfirmed bugs
----------------

* If the ball somehow manages to cross the net after point ends, AND it's the
  game point, camera for next serve gets a bit confused


v0.2 "Tejecasa" release milestone
--------------------------------

* QC


TODO
----

* Prevent attacks from hitting when over net

* Update spritesheet to have correct order of animations

* Make game's resolution scalable

* Doubles

* Step and bounce sound (per court)

* ConfigFile

  * Handle adding, removing, restoring config file

  * Automatically reload on change and allow manual reloading

* UI

  * Add options kind of button that cycles through options and invokes an event
    per

  * Display buffer in training mode

  * Add temporary best-of selection menu

  * Give buttons optional texture

  * Better control over UI elements' colours


Things to do on a quiet (or lazy) day
-------------------------------------

* Go through TODOs and HACKs

* Document more and better

* Remove unused System includes


Later
-----

* Refactor .ini debug to ShowX, ShowY

* Crowd SFX

* Add particles:

  * Sprint deceleration particles

  * Ball bounce particles

  * Initial dash particles

  * Jump/land particles

  * Special attack particles (silhouette sf3 kind of thing)

* Tournament variation of courts that have an upmpire, only accessible on 
  tournament mode or easter egg

* Add more characters (blocked: needs design)

* Winner text (blocked: needs design)

* Parallax background

* Music

* Add taunting

* DInput support (this is never gonna happen probably)


Conundrums
----------

* Custom amount of games?

* Maybe add notion of phantom hit which isn't accounted for by match manager, 
  which I picture being used for cool super moves

* Maybe add target combos?

* NonHeld buffer clearing mode allows sliding, which is very cool, but the
  trade-off is your run gets buffered after attacking, which feels very weird.
  It's not as bad as having no slide though... I think

* Should we have a Collisionmanager? Could be of use in Doubles

* Consider a special interaction (penalty) for when a hit depletes fully your
  stamina
