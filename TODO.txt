TennisFightingGame TODO List
============================


Known bugs to be fixed (by priority)
------------------------------------

1. Bottom collision correction is not calculated or applied correctly, resulting
   in players/ball sliding off the top of rectangles and then immediatly placed
   at its right, no matter from which direction the rectangle is jumped on top
   from

2. For some inexplicable reason, the lagFillRectangle is totally incorrect in
   training mode... despite nothing of note being different in how training
   handles bars as opposed to singles

3. Landing point isn't calculated correctly when bounce off of wall. While this
   is not intded to ever come in to play, it'd be nice to have it work correctly


Possibly fixed but unchecked
----------------------------

* The ball can sometimes go through geometry. Apparently only small geometry
  thickness-wise and at high velocity though

* Jumping on top of things doesn't work very well... But it's not like you're
  supposed to do that anyway... For now anyways

* If the ball somehow manages to cross the net after point ends, AND it's the
  game point, camera for next serve gets a bit confused

* Games don't end


v0.2 milestone
--------------

* Check whether games end

* General testing


TODO
----

* Update spritesheet to have correct order of animations

* Inputs viewer in training mode and general training overhaul

* Make game's resolution scalable

* Doubles (blocked: bug no. 1)

* Add temporary best-of selection menu

* Step and bounce sound (per court)

* UI overhaul:

  * Give buttons optional texture

  * Better control over UI elements' colours


Things to do on a quiet (or lazy) day
-------------------------------------

* Go through TODOs and HACKs

* Document more and better

* Remove unused System includes


Later
-----

* Crowd SFX

* Add particles:

  * Sprint deceleration particles

  * Ball bounce particles

  * Initial dash particles

  * Jump/land particles

  * Special attack particles (silhouette sf3 kind of thing)

* Tournament variation of courts that have an upmpire, only accessible on 
  tournament mode or easter egg

* Add more characters (blocked: needs design)

* Winner text (blocked: needs design)

* Parallax background

* Music

* Add taunting

* DInput support (this is never gonna happen probably)


Conundrums
----------

* Custom amount of games?

* Maybe add notion of phantom hit which isn't accounted for by match manager, 
  which I picture being used for cool super moves

* Maybe add target combos?

* NonHeld buffer clearing mode allows sliding, which is very cool, but the
  trade-off is your run gets buffered after attacking, which feels very weird.
  It's not as bad as having no slide though... I think

* Should we have a Collisionmanager? Could be of use in Doubles

* Consider a special interaction (penalty) for when a hit depletes fully your
  stamina
