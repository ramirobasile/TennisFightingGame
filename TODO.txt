TennisFightingGame TODO List
============================


Known bugs to be fixed
----------------------

* The ball can sometimes go through geometry. Apparently only small geometry
  thickness-wise and at high velocity though

* Landing point isn't calculated correctly when bounce off of wall

* There are now animations for attacks since they were reworked to not be
  index based. The solution is probably to attack animations to attacks

* For some inexplicable reason, the lagFillRectangle is totally incorrect in
  training mode... despite nothing of note being different in how training
  handles bars


Possibly fixed but unchecked
----------------------------

* Jumping on top of things doesn't work very well... But it's not like you're
  supposed to do that anyway... For now anyways

* If the ball somehow manages to cross the net after point ends, AND it's the
  game point, camera for next serve gets a bit confused

* Games don't end


TODO
----

* Go through TODOs and HACKs

* Step sounds and bounce sound (court specific)

* Character select portraits and stuff

* Inputs viewer in training mode and general training overhaul

* Make game's resolution scalable

* Document more and better

* Doubles (currently blocked by collision FIXME)


Minor TODOs
-----------

* Add more particles:

  * Sprint deceleration particles

  * Ball bounce particles

  * Initial dash particles

  * Jump/land particles

  * Special attack particles (silhouette sf3 kind of thing)

* Remove unused System includes

* Add best-of selection menu

* Tournament variation of courts that have an upmpire, only accessible on 
  tournament mode or easter egg


Conundrums
----------

* Custom amount of games?

* Maybe add notion of phantom hit which isn't accounted for by match manager, 
  which I picture being used for cool super moves

* Maybe add target combos?

* NonHeld buffer clearing mode allows sliding, which is very cool, but the
  trade-off is your run gets buffered after attacking, which feels very weird.
  It's not as bad as having no slide though... I think

* Should we have a Collisionmanager? Could be of use in Doubles

* Consider a special interaction (penalty) for when a hit depletes fully your
  stamina


Backburner
----------

* Rename Jorgito to Linyera and Wizard to Jorgito

* Add King

* Finish everyone's movesets

* Winner text

* Parallax background

* Music

* Crowd SFX

* Add taunting

* DInput support (this is never gonna happen probably)
