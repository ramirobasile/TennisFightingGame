TennisFightingGame TODO List
============================


Known bugs to be fixed
----------------------

* The ball can sometimes go through geometry. Apparently only small geometry 
  thickness-wise and at high velocity though

* Landing point isn't calculated correctly when bounce off of wall

* Fix attack animations


Possibly fixed but unchecked
----------------------------

* Jumping on top of things doesn't work very well... But it's not like you're
  supposed to do that anyway... For now anyways

* If the ball somehow manages to cross the net after point ends, AND it's the
  game point, camera for next serve gets a bit confused


TODO
----

* Change how we handle collision, probably just extend rectangle rather than
  having this ugly collider thingy

* Remove unused System includes

* Go through TODOs and HACKs

* Step sounds

* Special exhausted swing and hit sounds

* Character select portraits and stuff

* Inputs viewer in training mode and general training overhaul

* Allow scaling

* More documentation

* Add (and probably fix) particles

* Doubles (currently blocked by collision FIXME)


Minor TODOs
-----------

* Some of Monkey's attacks have 0 shakeMagnitude


Conundrums
----------

* Custom amount of games?

* Maybe add notion of phantom hit which isn't accounted for by match manager,
  which I picture being used for cool super moves

* Maybe add target combos?

* NonHeld buffer clearing mode allows sliding, which is very cool, but the
  trade-off is your run gets buffered after attacking, which feels very weird.
  It's not as bad as having no slide though... I think

* Should we have a Collisionmanager? Could be of use in Doubles

* Consider a special interaction (penalty) for when a hit depletes fully your
  stamina


Backburner
----------

* Winner text

* Finish Wizard

* Give Chino a special standing heavy (maybe)

* Give Monkey a billion specials

* Parallax background

* Music

* Crowd SFX

* Add taunting

* Titles

* XML character serialization

* DInput support (this is never gonna happen probably)
