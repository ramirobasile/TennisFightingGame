FIXMEs:
* ballFocus in singles camera isn't false on p2's first serve for some reason
* Jumping on top of things doesn't work very well... But it's not like you're 
  supposed to do that anyway
* Ball going thought geometry sometimes apparently only when ball's left 
  collision occurs
* You can input a dash right as serving and you'll be misaligned for the serve

TODOs:
* LandingPoint needs to take into account gravityScalar
* Step sounds
* More documentation
* Special exhausted swing and hit sounds
* Allow scaling
* Parallax background
* Particle system
* Doubles

Conundrums:
* Should the velocity set at bouncing scale off of the real ball's velocity or
  the velocity scaled by the gravityScalar?
* Should we have a Collisionmanager? Could be of use in Doubles
* Consider a special interaction (penalty) for when a hit depletes fully your
  stamina

Backburner TODOs:
* XML character specifications
* DInput support (this is never gonna happen probably)
* Target combos
