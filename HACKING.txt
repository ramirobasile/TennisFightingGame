FIXMEs:
* ballFocus in singles camera isn't false on p2's first serve for some reason
* Jumping on top of things doesn't work very well... But it's not like you're 
  supposed to do that anyway
* Ball going thought geometry sometimes apparently only when ball's left 
  collision occurs
* Landing point isn't calculated correctly when bounce off of wall

TODOs:
* "Busy" blocking time for player actions such as switching side or jumpsquat
* Add notion of phantom hit (which isn't accounted for by match manager)
* Add motion inputs
* Make attacks be bound to inputs rather than having them ordered by index
* Titles
* Step sounds
* More documentation
* Special exhausted swing and hit sounds
* Allow scaling
* Parallax background
* Add particles
* Doubles

Conundrums:
* Maybe add target combos?
* NonHeld buffer clearing mode allows sliding, which is very cool, but the
  trade-off is your run gets buffered after attacking, which feels very weird.
  It's not as bad as having no slide though... I think
* Should we have a Collisionmanager? Could be of use in Doubles
* Consider a special interaction (penalty) for when a hit depletes fully your
  stamina

Backburner TODOs:
* XML character serialization
* DInput support (this is never gonna happen probably)
