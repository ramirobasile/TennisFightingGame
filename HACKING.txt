Bugs
* Ball focus isn't false on p2's first serve for some reason, fix
* Jumping on top of things doesn't work very well... But it's not like you're 
  supposed to do that anyway
* Ball going thought geometry sometimes apparently only when ball's left 
  collision occurs
* You can input a dash right as serving and you'll be misaligned for the serve

General systems
* Rename namespaces according to parent folders of the source files
* Add shadow to ball
* Allow scaling
* Parallax background
* Particle system
* SFX for animations
* Doubles

Attacks
* Special exhausted swing and hit sounds
* Target combos

Misc.
* Ball bounce sound panning
* Fastfallinput
* More documentation

Backburner
* DInput support (this is never gonna happen probably)

Conundrums
* Should the velocity set at bouncing scale off of the real ball's velocity or
  the velocity scaled by the gravityScalar?
* Should we have a Collisionmanager? Could be of use in Doubles
* Consider a special interaction (penalty) for when a hit depletes fully your
  stamina
